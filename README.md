# SurvivalCE-Map-Maker-Tool
This is for the TI-84 CE graphing calculator. This is a on-calc program that is useful for making custom maps for SurvivalCE (also for the TI-84 CE)!

Developed specifically for the TI-84 Plus CE calculators.
Tested on version 5.3.0.0037 and it does work.



Controls:

Arrow keys = Move the Cursor

[Alpha] = Change the Block Type.

[2nd] = Place the block. Select the regular cursor (small grey rectangle) if you wish to delete/remove a block! 

[clear] = Quit the Editor. (Saves automatically)

[2], [4], [6], [8] = Move to another room.

[y=] = <only works when your cursor is on a placed door>  Open a building/house menu, allows you to design a single room for your building.

[stat] = view the list position in the Map (confusing to understand, for Developers)
